1,"Purpose: Metabolic perturbation and V<U+02D9>O2 on-kinetics are potential modifiers of fatigue and vary in importance depending on the exercise task. Thus, performance fatigability during high-intensity exercise seems to be exercise mode dependent, affecting tolerance in the severe domain. However, the effects of exercise mode on severe domain amplitude are still unknown. The aims of this study were to compare the severe domain amplitude in endurance runners and cyclists and to verify its possible determinants. Methods: Ten runners and eleven cyclists were tested to determine V<U+02D9>O2max, maximal velocity/power output of incremental test (vV<U+02D9>O2max/pV<U+02D9>O2max), critical velocity/power (CV/CP), distance/work above CV/CP (D'/W'), and the highest velocity/power output which V<U+02D9>O2max is attained during constant exercise (VHIGH/PHIGH). The severe domain amplitude was considered as VHIGH/PHIGH relative to CV/CP. Results: When normalized by vV<U+02D9>O2max/pV<U+02D9>O2max, although VHIGH and PHIGH were similar, CV (89.0 ± 2.2% vV<U+02D9>O2max) was higher than CP (84.0 ± 4.1% pV<U+02D9>O2max; p < .05; ES = 1.51). Consequently, the severe domain amplitude was higher in cyclists (153.6 ± 14.4% CP vs. 137.2 ± 14.6% CV; p < .05; ES = 1.13). Runners presented faster V<U+02D9>O2 on-kinetics than cyclists at VHIGH/PHIGH. The severe domain amplitude was correlated with D' (r = .65) and W' (r = .71), but not with V<U+02D9>O2 on-kinetics. Conclusions: Cyclists have a lower CP (%pV<U+02D9>O2max) and a greater severe domain amplitude than runners, providing a greater range of intensities for attainment of V<U+02D9>O2max. Furthermore, the severe domain amplitude appears to be linked to finite energy reserves, but unrelated to V<U+02D9>O2 on-kinetics."
2,"Purpose: To evaluate whether excess body mass influences the heart rate variability (HRV) indexes at rest, and to correlate adiposity indicators and the aerobic fitness with cardiac autonomic variables in metabolically healthy young adults. Method: In all, 41 untrained males (Mage = 21.80, SD = 2.14 years), 14 normal weight (MBMI = 22.28, SD = 1.86 kg·m-2), 11 overweight (MBMI = 26.95, SD = 1.43 kg·m-2), and 16 obese (MBMI = 33.58, SD = 3.06 kg·m-2) metabolically healthy (normal values of blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and total cholesterol), underwent evaluations of the HRV at rest and of the peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) during maximal exercise on a cycle ergometer. Results: Blood pressure, heart rate, HRV indexes, casual blood glucose, oxidative stress, and antioxidant activity did not differ among the groups. The VO2 peak (mL·kg-1·min-1) was lower in the obese group compared with the normal weight and overweight groups. The body mass (r = -.40 to -.45) and abdominal circumference (r = -.39 to -.52) were slightly to moderately correlated with SD1, SD2, RMSSD, SDNN, pNN50, LF, and HF indexes and total power. The VO2 peak (mL·kg-1·min-1) was slightly to moderately correlated (r = .48 to .51) with SD2, SDNN, and LF indexes in the individuals with excess body mass. Conclusion: Cardiac autonomic modulation at rest was preserved in metabolically healthy obese young men. However, the indicators of adiposity, as well as the aerobic fitness were correlated with cardiac autonomic modulation in the individuals with excess body mass."
3,"Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between fundamental movement skills (FMS) and markers of health among a cohort of Irish primary school children. Methods: Participants (N = 296, mean age: 7.99 ± 2.02 years) were senior infant (n = 149, mean age: 6.02 ± 0.39 years) and 4th class (n = 147, mean age: 9.97 ± 0.40 years) students from three primary schools in Cork, Ireland. FMS proficiency (TGMD-2) and markers of health (BMI percentile, waist circumference percentile, blood pressure percentiles, resting heart rate, cardiorespiratory fitness, objectively measured physical activity; PA) measurements were recorded. Correlation and hierarchical stepwise multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between FMS and markers of health. Results: A small, positive relationship was found between FMS (Gross Motor Quotient; GMQ) and cardiorespiratory fitness with small negative correlations between GMQ and 550 m time SDS among 6-year-olds (r(129) = -.286, p < .05) and 10-year-olds (r(132) = -.340, p < .05). A moderate, positive correlation was found between GMQ and light PA (r(71) = .400, p < .05). Small positive correlations were revealed between GMQ and moderate PA (r(71) = .259, p < .05) and between GMQ and total PA (r(71) = .355, p < .05). After adjusting for age, sex, the interaction effect of age and sex, and school attended, FMS explained 15.9% and 24.8% of the variance in 550 m time SDS among 6- and 10-year-olds, respectively, and 6% and 6.5% of the variance in light PA and moderate PA, respectively. After adjusting for age and sex, FMS explained 11.6% of the variance in total PA. Conclusion: A wide range of FMS is important for children’s cardiorespiratory fitness and PA."
4,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to test the effects of chair-based exercise programs on salivary stress hormones, physical fitness, and functional autonomy of institutionalized older women. Method: In total, 47 participants (80 ± 8.04 years old) were recruited and allocated into three groups: chair-based aerobic exercises (CAE, n = 19), chair-based elastic-band strength exercises (CSE, n = 15), and a control group (CG, n = 13). A 14-week exercise intervention was done for the CAE and CSE groups, two times per week, in no consecutive days. Members of the CG did not participate in any type of exercise but kept their regular lifestyle. Fear of falling, autonomy, physical fitness, salivary cortisol, and alpha-amylase levels were assessed before and after the intervention. Results: The CAE group improved upper and lower body strength, agility–dynamic balance, and autonomy, with fear of falling decreasing significantly (p < .05, moderate effect size). Both exercise groups showed a trend toward an increase in salivary alpha-amylase levels (CAE = 43%, d = .31, and CSE = 44%, d = .41). Conclusion: Both exercise programs were able to improve functional autonomy, even in elders older than 80 years of age. It might be interesting to investigate the effectiveness of combining both aerobic and strength exercises in a unique protocol. The modulation effect of exercise in the hormonal responses needs to be further explored."
5,"Purpose: To compare the effects of three water-based resistance trainings on neuromuscular parameters of older women. Method: Thirty-six women were randomized to groups: simple set of 30 seconds (1 × 30 s, 66.41 ± 4.71 years, n = 12), multiple sets of 10 seconds (3 × 10 s, 66.50 ± 4.74 years, n = 11), and simple set of 10 seconds (1 × 10 s, 65.23 ± 3.93 years, n = 13). Maximal isometric strength concomitantly with neuromuscular activity during extension and flexion knee was evaluated. In the same exercises, rate of force development at different time intervals was measured. Finally, functional capacity was assessed. Results: All trainings promoted similar improvements in the rate of force develpment of extension (effect size RFD 50 ms: 1 × 30 s .49, 3 × 10 s .67, 1 × 10 s .65; ES RFD 100 ms: 1 × 30 s .76, 3 × 10 s .80, 1 × 10 s .63; ES RFD 250 ms: 1 × 30 s .31, 3 × 10 s .49, 1 × 10 s .37) and flexion knee (ES RFD 50 ms: 1 × 30 s .59, 3 × 10 s .31, 1 × 10 s .48; ES RFD 100 ms: 1 × 30 s .41, 3 × 10 s .44, 1 × 10 s .42; ES RFD 250 ms: 1 × 30 s .57, 3 × 10 s .36, 1 × 10 s .43; ES RFD maximal: 1 × 30 s .63, 3 × 10 s .23, 1 × 10 s .26), however only the 3 × 10 s group improved the performance in the 8-foot up-and-go test (ES 3 × 10 s: .93, 1 × 30: .39, 1 × 10 s: .23). There was a maintenance of the isometric force and neuromuscular activity, except for the activity of the rectus femoris that showed an increase after training in all groups (ES 3 × 10 s: .04, 1 × 30: .36, 1 × 10 s: .50). Conclusion: Water-based resistance training using simple or multiple sets promotes the same gains in rapid strength, however only multiple sets induced improvement on functional capacity."
6,"Purpose: In team sports, players have to manage personal interests and group goals, emphasizing intricacies between personal and social identities. The focus of this article was to examine the effect of identity mechanisms on appraisal processes, based on the following research question: Does the level of self-abstraction (low [personal identity] versus high [social identity]) lead to group-based emotions and influence performances? Method: An experimental design was used in which the level of self-abstraction was manipulated through the induction of a self- versus a team-oriented goal. Thirty elite male rugby players (Mage = 19.06, SD = 0.78, randomly split) participated in a match reproducing conditions similar to those of official games. Individual and perceived team-level emotions and performance were measured 17 times during the match. Results: Linear Mixed Effects models showed that a high level of self-abstraction: (a) led to more positive and less negative individual (variances explained: 52% and 46%) and perceived team-referent (variances explained: 57% and 40%) emotions; (b) reduced the correlation of team-referent emotions with individual ones; and (c) positively influenced team and individual performances (variances explained: 50% and 19%). Moreover, after controlling for potential effects of the level of self-abstraction, only positive team-referent emotions influenced performance. Conclusions: This study is the first to experimentally manipulate athletes’ social identity to examine group-based emotions in sport. Challenging the usual intrapersonal approaches, these findings suggested that social identity and its association with team-referent emotions could be one of the key dimensions of emotion-performance relationships in team sports."
7,"Purpose: To evaluate the relationship between years of collegiate playing experience and success of NCAA Division I volleyball programs. Methods: Data were gathered from the 2010–2015 seasons for each volleyball program in the “power five” conferences. Players that were involved in at least 66% of the sets were selected for analysis. Each player’s years of college experience were tabulated and a team average experience score was created. This score was correlated with the end of season Ratings Percentage Index (RPI). Years with a significant correlation between success and experience were further analyzed for differences in on-court statistics by years of experience. Results:  The range for team average experience score was 2.52–2.66. Only the 2012 season showed a moderate correlation between the team average score and RPI (<U+03C1> = -0.421, p = .001), indicating that more experienced teams finished with a higher national ranking. Within this year, teams with more experience had a statistically significant (p < .05) higher season win percentage, higher conference win percentage, higher hitting percentage, more kills/set, and more assists/set than teams with low or only moderate experience. Conclusions: These data suggest that more collegiate playing experience does not always result in a significantly more successful season, but trends indicate that a relationship does exist between experience and success. In the one year that showed significance, more experienced teams had more favorable statistics related to skills that terminate play (e.g., kills) rather than ball control skills (e.g., digs and passing)."
8,"Purpose: This study tested two hypotheses relating young athletes’ sports motivations to parental behaviors and cognitive appraisal: (1) young athletes’ motivation in sports is related to their parents’ behavior; and (2) this relationship is mediated by cognitive appraisal, even after controlling for competitive level and sports records. Method: This cross-sectional study included 673 young athletes and it measured the athletes’ perceptions of parental behaviors, cognitive appraisal, and sports motivation. Results: Structural equation modeling confirmed Hypothesis 1–the mother’s behaviors accounted for 15 to 16% of the variance in sports motivation, and the father’s behaviors accounted for 12 to 21% of the variance. The correlation patterns differed according to whether the athletes were evaluating the mother’s or father’s behaviors. Hypothesis 2 also was confirmed, for cognitive appraisal partially mediated the relationship between the perception of parental behaviors and sports motivation (34% of the variance was accounted for by the perception of the mother’s behavior; 30% by the father’s). The mediating model did not vary with competitive level or sports records. Conclusion: Parental behaviors and cognitive appraisal need to be taken into account to understand young athletes’ sports motivations."
9,"Purpose: Resistance training is often performed in a traditional training style using deliberate relatively longer repetition durations or in an explosive training style using maximal intended velocities and relatively shorter repetition durations. Both improve strength, “power” (impulsivity), and speed. This study compared explosive and traditional training over a 6-week intervention in 30 healthy young adult male recreational soccer players. Method: Full body supervised resistance training was performed 2 times a week using 3 sets of each exercise at 80% of one repetition maximum to momentary failure. Outcomes were Smith machine squat 1 repetition maximum, 10 meter sprint time, and countermovement jump. Results: Both groups significantly improved all outcomes based on 95% confidence intervals not crossing zero. There were no between-group differences for squat 1 RM (TRAD = 6.3[5.1 to 7.6] kg, EXP = 5.2[3.9 to 6.4] kg) or 10 meter sprint (TRAD = -0.05[-0.07 to -0.04] s, EXP = -0.05[-0.06 to -0.03] s). Explosive group had a significantly greater increase in countermovement jump compared to the traditional group (TRAD = 0.7[0.3 to 1.1] cm, EXP = 1.3[0.9 to 1.7] cm). Conclusion: Both the traditional training and explosive training performed to momentary failure produced significant improvements in strength, speed, and jump performance. Strength gains are similar independent of intended movement speed. However, speed and jump performance changes are marginal with resistance training."
10,"Purpose: To summarize the framework and development procedure of the China National Assessment of Education Quality - Physical Education & Health in 2015 (CNAEQ-PEH 2015), an authoritative and evidence-based national surveillance protocol developed by the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China for Grade 4 and Grade 8 students. Methods: The framework of CNAEQ-PEH 2015 included a test battery of physical fitness and health outcomes and self-reported questionnaires regarding facilitators and barriers to physical fitness and health in school settings and family status, completed by students, teachers, and principals. A qualified, standardized, and responsible work procedure was generated to provide insights into the quality of data collection and supervision of large-scale school-based physical fitness testing implementation. Measure development, stratified unequal probability sampling, and implementation were included in the working procedure. Results: In the first circle of the CNAEQ-PEH conducted on June 18, 2015, 111,173 Grade 4 students from 4,015 elementary schools and 72,243 Grade 8 students from 2,461 middle schools, along with their principals (n = 6,447) and physical education (PE) teachers (n = 11,418), were sampled by probability proportionate to size (PPS) across 323 counties in China. Results provided detailed information regarding students’ physical fitness outcomes, learning, lifestyle, and educational environment. Conclusions: CNAEQ-PEH 2015 is a large-scale assessment of physical fitness and health outcomes. It helps provide opportunities to understand the physical fitness and health status of Chinese Grade 4 and 8 students and to study the correlations of physical fitness and health, as well as their relationship with education-related indicators and academic performance."
11,"Purpose: This study examined the prevalence of different weight status and the relationships between weight status and physical fitness among Chinese children and youth. Methods: Participants were 107,206 Grade 4 children and 70,213 Grade 8 youth from the China National Assessment of Educational Quality – Physical Education & Health in 2015 (CNAEQ-PEH 2015). Using World Health Organization (WHO) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria, weight status was divided into four groups (underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese) according to Body Mass Index (BMI). The differences of physical fitness performances (15-m progressive aerobic cardiovascular endurance run [PACER], standing long jump, and 50-m sprint) among four weight status groups were compared. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, MANCOVA, and Cohen’s d. Results: The prevalence of weight status varied by criteria (e.g., for Grade 4 boys, the prevalence of underweight by WHO and CDC were 5.9% and 10.5%; overweight were 14.5% and 11.4%, respectively). Compared with the normal weight group, the selected physical fitness performances in the overweight and obese groups were worse (p < .001) with small to large effect sizes. Conclusion: The prevalence of underweight and overweight/obese was relatively high among Chinese children and youth. The prevalence of underweight, overweight, and obesity varied slightly depending on the criteria used for evaluating BMI. The overweight/obese participants tended to perform poorer in selected physical fitness tests. The performance disparities between the normal weight group and overweight/obese groups were larger in Grade 4 than in Grade 8 and among boys than among girls."
12,"Purpose: Physical education (PE) in school provides opportunities for physical activity (PA) engagement and reportedly results in improved health-related fitness. This study explored the underlying correlations between PE and activity-related healthy lifestyle practices with current level of cardiorespiratory fitness. Methods: A total of 13,138 students age 14 (boys = 7,094, 54.0%) in Grade 8 from the China National Assessment of Educational Quality - Physical Education & Health 2015 were included in this study. Two independent structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses were conducted to obtained sex-specific results. Data included the results of the 15-m progressive aerobic cardiovascular endurance run (PACER) and questionnaire data regarding PE curriculum implementation, learning and practice, perceived support from PE teachers, PE facilities, PE equipment, activity-related healthy lifestyle practices, habitual physical fitness, appropriate method of physical fitness, and breakfast eating habits. Structural equation modeling was applied to examine the associations between variables, controlling for socioeconomic status, the location of schools, and Body Mass Index. Results: There was a statistically significant relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and activity-related healthy lifestyle practices, which was somewhat positively impacted by skill learning and practice and perceived support from PE teachers. Together, the boy’s model explained 21.8% of the variance in cardiorespiratory fitness, whereas the girl’s model explained 15.9%. Conclusions: A well-organized PE program is related to students’ activity-related healthy lifestyle practices, and consequently provides an improvement to cardiorespiratory fitness."
13,"Purpose: Previous studies indicated a positive association between physical education (PE) and mathematics achievement (MA). This study explored how PE curriculum implementation relates to MA using data from the China National Assessment of Education Quality (CNAEQ) in 2015, including Mathematics (CNAEQ-MA 2015) as well as Physical Education & Health (CNAEQ-PEH 2015). Method: This study included 22,619 students (48.7% girls) age 13.96 ± 0.64 yr. from the national sample of Grade 8 students from CNAEQ. During 2015, MA and cardiorespiratory fitness (CF) were assessed. PE curriculum implementation, personal hygiene, eating habits, PE interest, mathematics interest, and self-confidence were collected via a self-report student survey. Personal hygiene and eating habits were combined to create the latent variable, healthy lifestyle (HL). Structural equation modeling was applied to examine the associations. Socioeconomic status, school location, Body Mass Index (BMI), and sex were all controlled. Results: PE curriculum implementation had an indirect, positive association with MA through CF, HL-mathematics interest, and HL-mathematics self-confidence. Together, the model explained 27.8% of the variance in MA. Conclusion: PE curriculum implementation may benefit mathematics education, and this link is mainly through HL, CF, mathematics interest, and self-confidence."
14,"Purpose: To determine if weight training combined with pelvic floor muscle training is more efficient than pelvic floor muscle training alone for the treatment of urinary incontinence (UI) symptoms in elderly women. Method: This was a two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial. Twenty-six women with stress UI participated in the study. The intervention group (IG) underwent training with moderate intensity weights combined with pelvic floor muscle training, whereas the control group (CG) only underwent pelvic floor muscle training. Intervention occurred twice a week over 12 weeks. The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire–Short Form was used as the main measure. Scores of zero defined the absence of symptoms. The absence of symptoms was evaluated at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1 month after the end of treatment. Moreover, activities related to UI and the use and change of daily protection were investigated. Results: The rate of absence of symptoms was significantly higher in IG after 4 weeks (58.3%) compared to CG (14.8%). The relative risk was 4.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] [1.08, 16.06]). Although no intention-to-treat analysis was performed, there was no difference in the evaluations after the interventions. Conclusion: Compared to pelvic floor muscle training alone, the combination of weight training and pelvic floor muscle training provided earlier improvement of UI in elderly women."
15,"Purpose: A systematic review was conducted to identify facilitators and barriers to movement integration (MI) in elementary school classrooms. Method: Online databases (Educational Resources Information Center, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and PubMed) served as data sources for the study. Following the PRISMA guidelines, relevant published research on MI was identified and screened for inclusion in a qualitative synthesis. Content analysis of the included articles (N = 28) was used to identify themes of MI facilitators and barriers. Facilitators and barriers were then categorized using a social-ecological framework. Results: A total of 12 themes of MI facilitators and barriers were identified and categorized into two social-ecological levels: institutional factors (e.g., administrative support, resources) and intrapersonal factors (e.g., teacher confidence, ease of implementation). Conclusion: This review can inform research and practice aimed at supporting the implementation of MI in elementary classrooms."
16,"Purpose: To examine the capacity of physiological variables and performance to predict peak oxygen consumption (peak V<U+02D9>O2) in children and adolescents living with HIV. Method: Sixty-five children and adolescents living with HIV (30 boys) aged 8–15 years, participated in the study. Peak V<U+02D9>O2 was measured by breath-by-breath respiratory exchange during an incremental cycle ergometer until volitional exhaustion. Information on the time to exhaustion, maximal power output (Pmax), and peak heart rate (peak HR) were also recorded. Results: Predictive models were developed and all equations showed the ability of performance variables to predict peak V<U+02D9>O2. However, Model 1 was based only on Pmax by following equation: Y = 338.8302 + (Pmax [W] * 11.16435), R2 = 0.90 and standard error of estimation (SEE) = 180 ml·min-1. Conclusion: The V<U+02D9>O2 peak can be predicted simply by the Pmax obtained from the incremental cycle ergometer test. This protocol is a valid and useful tool for monitoring the aerobic fitness of children and adolescents living with HIV, especially in resource-limited settings."
17,"Purpose: The purpose of this work is focused on the study of the effect that feedback has on competence valuation, perceived competence, autonomous motivation, vitality, and performance in a throwing task. Method: Thirty-five college students (26 men and 9 women), without previous experience in the task, participated in this study. The students were randomly assigned to three experimental conditions (positive, negative, and lack of feedback). Results: The results of this study point out that only those who received positive feedback before the handball throwing task, in contrast to those who received negative feedback or did not receive any feedback, showed increased levels of competence valuation (p < .05, Cliff’s delta effect size = -.30), perceived competence (p < .001, Cliff’s delta effect size = -.77), and autonomous motivation (p < .05, Cliff’s delta effect size = -.48). This group also presented higher levels of perceived competence (p < .001, Cliff’s delta effect size = -.84) and subjective vitality (p < .001, Cliff’s delta effect size = -.80) than the group who received negative feedback after the throwing task. Those who received positive feedback also showed a higher throwing speed at the end of task than those who received negative feedback (p < 0.001, Cliff’s delta effect size = -.71) or than those who did not receive any feedback (p < .05, Cliff’s delta effect size = -.56). Conclusions: Competence valuation, perceived competence, autonomous motivation, subjective vitality, and throwing speed were favorably influenced by positive feedback. These results have important implications for the training style applied by coaches."
18,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of eight different small-sided games (SSG) on physical, technical, and decision-making demands of training environments in U14 field hockey. Methods: A total of 13 participants played eight different training games consisting of two 7.5-minute halves, where number of players (three per side or six per side) and/or field characteristics (normal game, cage hockey game, possession game, and two-goals game) was manipulated. Match performance was determined by using notational analysis, and physical demands were determined by using GPS analyses. Results: Findings revealed that lowering the number of players increased the number of technical actions performed per player and the physical demands of the SSG. Findings of the field characteristics manipulation revealed that the possession game forced players to control the ball more as a team, which resulted in more passes (+4.82 passes) and fewer dribbles (-1.48 dribbles) and tackles (-0.69 tackles) compared to the normal game. The two-goals game led to players scoring more goals (+0.61 goals) compared to the normal game, while the cage hockey game increased passing (+1.46 passes) and physical demands (+7.32 meters per minute) compared to the normal game. Conclusion: It can be concluded from these findings that coaches and trainers are able to promote a change in playing behavior, and in turn the development of skills, by manipulating specific constraints of the training environment."
19,"Purpose: Overuse injuries are common in sport, but complete understanding of injury risk factors remains incomplete. Although biomechanical studies frequently examine musculoskeletal injury mechanisms, human movement variability studies aim to better understand neuromotor functioning, with proposed connections between overuse injury mechanisms and changes in motor variability. Method: In a narrative review, we discuss the variability-overuse injury hypothesis, which suggests repeated load application leads to mechanical tissue breakdown and subsequent injury when exceeding the rate of physiological adaptation. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of this hypothesis, we incorporate concepts from motor control, neurophysiology, biomechanics, as well as research design and data analysis. We therefore summarize multiple perspectives while proposing theoretical relationships between movement variability and lower extremity overuse injuries. Results: Experimental data are presented and summarized from published experiments examining interactions between experimental task demands and movement variability in the context of drop landing movements, along with comparisons to previous movement variability studies. Conclusion: We provide a conceptual framework for sports medicine researchers interested in predicting and preventing sports injuries. Under performance conditions with greater task demands, we predict reduced trial-to-trial movement variability that could increase the likelihood of overuse injuries."
20,"Purpose: This study sought to explore students’ experiences of the Fitness Integrated with Technology (F.I.T.) unit and of their perceptions of using technology in physical education. Method: This manuscript is part of a larger mixed-methods study that measured student attitude and physical activity (PA) levels of 221 students in sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. Selected students (N = 13; seven girls) were observed and then interviewed after the unit through semistructured interviews. Students were identified based on their PA levels and attitude scores from a baseline measurement. The unit was designed to deliver fitness-based knowledge and used accelerometers as a tool to measure and teach students about PA. Results: Three themes emerged from the data analysis: (a) technology and problems implementing it, (b) homework in PE, and (c) potential motivational effects of technology. The lack of access to technology at home and the design and utility of the accelerometers were perceived barriers. Additionally, homework was not well received. The accelerometer seemed to have a motivational effect on increasing students’ PA levels but wore off during the unit. Conclusions: Results demonstrate that the use of technology for some students was a motivating factor to increase PA, and the use of accelerometers was a welcomed addition for students. Some students, however, raised concerns with the integration of technology such as the bulkiness of the accelerometer, not being able to wear it at sporting events, a novelty effect, and lack of access to technology at home that limited their interaction with their accelerometer data."
21,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine magnitudes of differences for anthropometric and athletic performance scores between high school and elite college-level American football players. Method: Participants included high school-age (n = 3,666) athletes who participated in American football combines, as well as elite college-level (n = 5,537) athletes who participated in the National Football League (NFL) scouting combine. Combine data included position; height; weight; 10-, 20-, and 40-yard dash; pro-agility (PA); L-cone drill (LC); vertical jump (VJ); and broad jump (BJ). Athletes were separated into their respective position group, defensive back (DB), wide receiver (WR), linebacker (LB), quarterback (QB), running back (RB), tight end (TE), defensive line (DL), and offensive line (OL) for analysis of performance differences. Percent differences for each dependent variable were calculated to quantify magnitudes of differences. Results: NFL combine participants scored 3% to 25% better on all measurements, with the largest differences between weight and VJ (14%–25%). Conclusion: The largest measurement-specific differences between high school-age and elite college-level American football players were body size and power. Although it may seem intuitive that elite college-level players would perform better, these data provide a unique perspective to high school players, parents, and coaches, giving new information to use when designing measurement-specific athletic development programs. Thus, strength and conditioning professionals may benefit from emphasizing increases in muscle mass and power output in strength and conditioning programs."
22,"Purpose: The powerful activity profile of elite soccer match play has not been documented appropriately to inform specific maximal power assessment and development criteria. The aims of the current study were to develop a reliable  soccer-specific powerful action (SSPA) notational analysis coding system that could be used to compare frequency and durations of powerful actions during elite youth soccer match play. Methods: Sixteen elite male English Premier League (EPL) Academy players (19 ± 1 yrs) were recorded by an individual camera during 16 competitive EPL U18 and U21 games. Video footage was analyzed using performance analysis software and SSPAs were coded according to the following categories: initial acceleration, leading acceleration, sprint, unilateral jump and bilateral jump. Results: The SSPA coding system demonstrated very good inter- and intra-rater reliability (kappa coefficients = 0.827). Elite youth EPL soccer players undertook significantly more initial (31 ± 9) and leading (37 ± 12) accelerations than sprints (8 ± 3; p = .014, d = 1.7, and p < .001, d = 1.7, respectively) and jumps (6 ± 5; p = .002, d = 1.7 and p < .001, d = 1.7, respectively). Players performed a significantly greater number of initial and leading accelerations with action durations below 1.5 s compared to above 1.5 s (p = .001, d = 1.6, and p = .002, d = 1.4), respectively. Conclusions: Our SSPA coding system provides a reliable observational instrument for quantifying the frequency and duration of powerful actions performed during elite soccer match play. In our sample of elite youth soccer players, horizontal accelerations of short duration (< 1.5 s) from different starting speeds appear the most dominant powerful action in elite youth soccer match play."
23,"Purpose: This study compared the energy system contributions and relationship between mechanical and energy system variables in upper and lower body Wingate tests (WAnT) in judo athletes. Method: Eleven male judo athletes (18 ± 1 years, 174.3 ± 5.3 cm, 72.6 ± 9.9 kg, 11.8 ± 1.7% body fat) attended two laboratory sessions to perform two WAnT (upper and lower body) and two incremental tests (upper and lower body). The energy contributions of the oxidative, glycolytic, and phosphagen (ATP-PCr) systems were estimated based on oxygen consumption (V<U+02D9>O2) during WAnT, delta of lactate, and the fast phase of excess V<U+02D9>O2, respectively. Results: The upper and lower body presented similar results of oxidative (21 ± 4% vs 23 ± 3%) and ATP-PCr system contributions (29 ± 6% vs 32 ± 5%). The glycolytic system contribution (50 ± 5% vs 45 ± 4%) was higher in the upper body. The variance of mechanical variables in upper body was explained by glycolytic (R2 = 0.49–0.62) and oxidative systems (R2 = 0.44–0.49), whereas the variance of mechanical variables in lower body was explained by ATP-PCr (R2 = 0.41–0.55) and glycolytic systems (R2 = 0.62–0.94). Conclusions: During WAnT, the glycolytic system presented the major energy contribution, being higher in the upper body. Moreover, mechanical and energy system variables presented a distinct relationship when comparing upper and lower body WAnT."
24,"Purpose: Vertical jump is a common test to measure impulsive ability in soccer; however, limited normative data have been published on young soccer players from vertical jump measurements on a force platform. The purpose of this study was to provide normative values for three chronological age groups of male junior soccer players (U16, U17 and, U18 years). Method: Vertical jump performance of 365 soccer players (16.4 ± 0.8 years) was assessed using a force platform measurement system. Net impulse, force, power, jump height (impulse-momentum), jump height (flight time) were reported for each age group for squat jump (SJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ). Results: Mean values ± SD of jump height were 32.9 ± 4.1, 33.5 ± 4.0, and 33.9 ± 4.2 cm for the three age groups respectively in SJ and 36.3 ± 3.8, 37.5 ± 3.9, and 38.6 ± 4.4 cm in the CMJ. Mean values of all age groups for maximum force and maximum power were 1559 ± 211 N and 3261 ± 492 watt respectively for SJ and 1598 ± 241 N and 3287 ± 502 watt for CMJ. Based on descriptive data, percentiles were reported for all examined variables. Conclusions: Jump height and relative values were less sensitive discriminator variables between age groups in the studied age range, while maximum impulse, maximum force, and maximum power were more sensitive to changes in maturational status. Normative values can be used by the coaches in the interpretation and evaluation of their athletes’ performance and for training and talent identification purposes."
25,"Purpose: This study followed a strengths-based approach to identify the pathway children follow as they develop from novice to skillful learners during a mastery-motivational physical education setting. Method: Eleven 4-year-old children (nine boys) participated in a motor activity program delivered twice weekly across 26 weeks. The teacher participated in monthly 30–45-min interviews that sought to identify the critical moments of the program as it had progressed to that point in time. Photographic images of the children’s experiences in the climate acted as prompts during interviews. Interview transcripts were subject to a deductive analysis in which the ideas of “what was working well” and “what the future might look like” were the initial categories. Results: Interview and photo analyses revealed that the children moved through three phases on their pathway towards mastery. In phase 1, “captivation” and “exploration,” the children presented the teacher with challenges in developing the managerial system. In phase 2, “cooperation” and “consolidation,” there was significantly less task modification and more time in deliberate practice. In phase 3, “dedication” and “collaboration,” the children began to actively seek out the teacher as a resource to help them learn. Conclusions: The identification of critical teaching behaviors during the program adds support for our contention that the teacher is a critical component in helping children advance along the pathway of mastery when placed in an autonomy-supportive climate. These are allowing time for exploration and experiencing freedom, adding structure, and helping students learn to manage themselves."
26,"Purpose: This research investigated whether Zimmerman’s model of self-regulated learning could be transferred into a competitive setting. We also investigated whether a feedforward self-modeling video could influence one’s use of self-regulation and as such be an effective self-regulatory intervention. Methods: Nine competitive gymnasts took part in two interviews; one interview was conducted after a competition in which the video was viewed (experimental interview: EI) and the other after a competition where no video was seen (control interview: CI). Results: The gymnasts’ responses to the interviews suggested that many processes and beliefs used in the learning context described by Zimmerman were also engaged in within a competitive context. Furthermore, comparison of gymnasts’ responses between the EI and CI suggested that the feedforward self-modeling video influenced gymnasts’ use of self-regulation during a competition. Conclusion: This research suggests that Zimmerman’s model of self-regulation has potential to be transmitted into the competitive context and that an individual’s self-regulation can be influenced by viewing a feedforward self-modeling video."
27,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of 3- vs. 2-minute inter maximal-repetition rest period (IMRRP) on maintaining jerk technical efficiency and power production during two successive maximal repetitions of Clean & Jerk (C&J). Methods: In a randomized, within subject, repeated measures design, nine elite-weightlifters (age: 24.4 ± 3.6 years, body mass: 77.2 ± 7.1 kg, height 176.0 ± 6.4 cm and 1RM C&J: 170.0 ± 5.0 kg) performed 2-separate testing sessions using 2 (IMRRP-2) and 3 (IMRRP-3) -minute IMRRP, while barbell kinematics and kinetics and joint kinematics were recorded. Results: Statistical analysis showed that one minute longer IMRRP enhanced the maintenance of optimal jerk technique evidenced by reducing declines in peak vertical barbell displacement (2.74%; p = .03), peak barbell velocity (2.89%; p = .03), and peak knee (1.61%; p = .03) and hip extensions (1.59%; p = .03) during the drive phase of the jerk. Additionally, IMRRP-3 led to maintaining optimal lifting strategy by reducing the increase in horizontal displacement during the descending (3.85%; p = .04) and ascending (5.42%; p = .02) phases. Increasing IMRRP from 2min to 3min was also shown to enhance kinetic variables evidenced by prompting higher peak vGRF (2.01%; p = .04) and power (2.55%; p = .04). Conclusion: To better identify an athlete’s maximal jerk technique and power maintenance, the results of this study suggest 3min as more appropriate IMRRP during successive C&J at 100% 1RM."
28,"In basketball, game-related statistics are the most common measure of performance. However, the literature assessing their reliability is scarce. Purpose: Analyze the number of games required to obtain a good relative and absolute reliability of teams’ game-related statistics. Method: A total of 884 games from the 2015–2016 to 2017–2018 seasons of the Spanish men’s professional league were analyzed using all games and clustered by scoring difference. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for each variable. The number of games required to detect a change and to achieve good relative reliability was calculated using minimal detectable change and Spearman-Brown prophecy formula respectively. Results: Using all games, the results showed that the minimal number of games required in each group was 30 to detect a medium change (d > .5), 187 for a small change (d > .2), and 100 for good relative reliability (ICC = .75). Using balanced and unbalanced games, the minimal number of games required in each group was respectively 31 and 30 to detect a medium change (d > .5), 190 and 188 for a small change (d > .2), and 191 and 121 for good relative reliability (ICC = .75). Conclusions: The sample needs to consist of at least 30 games in each group to detect a medium size change, and at least 190 games to detect a small size change. To be able to rank teams with good reliability, at least 100 games are required when including both balanced and unbalanced games."
29,"Purpose: Heat intolerance (HI) is determined in the Israel Defense Force according to a heat tolerance test (HTT) before returning to duty after an exertional heat stroke (EHS) event. Recently, increased numbers of female combatants resulted in an increased number of EHS cases among women and a higher percentage of heat intolerance (HI) individuals. We aimed to evaluate the differences between tolerance to heat among women performing an HTT in relation to their menstrual cycle phase. Method: Thirty-three female participants were sorted into two groups: HI and heat tolerant (HT) according to two HTTs performed during both the luteal and follicular phases of the menstrual cycle or while consuming and during a break from consuming contraceptives. Results: HT women had an 18% higher maximal oxygen uptake (p < .005, 95% CI [2.6,9.8]) and 1.2% lower skin temperature in the HTT at the during and follicular phases (p < .01, 95% CI [0.12,0.77]) and 1.7% lower at the off and luteal phases (p < .001, 95% CI [0.34,0.92]). The mean sweat rate was 14% lower among the HI group only at the HTT at the during and follicular phases (p < .05, 95% CI (3,88)]). Conclusion: We found that HT can be predicted using aerobic capacity and core body temperature. Moreover, during the luteal phase, women presented altered thermoregulation that decreased the probability of being HT. This emphasizes the importance of considering the HT/HI criteria in the HTT for women, according to their aerobic ability and menstrual-cycle phase."
30,"Purpose: This study investigated the effects of the menstrual cycle on running economy (RE). Method: Eleven eumenorrheic female athletes (mean age: 21.18 ± 3.65 years, height: 170.2 ± 6.6 cm, VO2max: 49.25 ± 9.15 mL·kg-1·min-1, and menstrual cycle: 29.8 ± 0.98 days) were tested for anthropometric variables, physiological responses (oxygen consumption [VO2], blood lactate [LA], heart rate [HR], and respiratory exchange ratio [RER]) at rest and while running. The RE was measured at speeds of 75%, 85%, and 95% of the lactate threshold at 3.5 mmol·L-1 during the follicular (FP) and luteal phases (LP) of the menstrual cycle. The RE was evaluated as oxygen consumption (mL·kg·min-1 [O2C_min], mL·kg-1·km-1 [O2C_km]) and caloric unit cost (kcal·kg-1·km-1 [EC]) during both phases. Results: There were no significant differences in body composition or resting physiological measurements between the LP and FP (p > .05). Physiological responses measured during RE tests were similar in both phases (p > .05). The RE measured as O2C_min, O2C_km, and EC was significantly lower during the LP than during the FP (p < .05). The RE defined as O2C_ min significantly increased with speed (p < .05), but RE defined as O2C_km and EC was unaffected by speed increment (p > .05). Conclusions: The RE is better in the LP than the FP and is independent of running speed when RE is evaluated as O2C_km and EC. The menstrual cycle had no effect on body composition and physiological variables measured at rest."
31,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the widely used accelerometer activity cut-points derived from the absolute moderate intensity recommendation (3<U+2012>6 METs), with relative intensity cut-points according to maximal cardiorespiratory fitness (46%<U+2012>63% V<U+02D9>O2max) and to individual lactate thresholds (LT1 and LT2) in postmenopausal women. Method: Thirty postmenopausal women performed several exercise tests with measures of heart rate, blood lactate, accelerometer activity counts and oxygen consumption. Individual regressions were developed to derive the accelerometer activity counts at absolute and relative moderate intensity recommendations and at individual LTs. Results: The activity counts calculated at the lower moderate intensity boundary were lower for the absolute 3 METs threshold (2026 ± 808 ct·min-1) compared to relative 46 % V<U+02D9>O2max intensity threshold (p < .01, ES: 1.95) and LT1 (p < .01, ES: 2.27), which corresponded to 4.6 ± 0.7 METs. The activity counts at the upper moderate intensity boundary were higher for LT2 (7249 ± 2499 ct·min-1) compared to the absolute 6 METs threshold (p < .01, ES: 0.72) and relative 63% V<U+02D9>O2max intensity threshold (p < .01, ES: 0.55). The interindividual variability in activity counts at relative intensity thresholds was high (CV = 30–34%), and was largely explained by cardiorespiratory fitness level (R2 = ~ 50%). Conclusion: Individually tailored (relative to V<U+02D9>O2max or submaximal LTs) rather than fixed accelerometer intensity cut-points derived from the classic absolute moderate physical activity intensity (3–6 METs) would result in a more accurate measurement of an individual´s activity levels and reduce the risk of overestimating or underestimating physical activity."
32,"Purpose: The aim of the study was to analyze the accuracy of impedance cardiography (ICG) for hemodynamic assessment in wheelchair rugby players during rest and exercise. Method: The study included 21 players (mean age 33.0 ± 5.4, 86% male) with posttraumatic tetraplegia. ECG, echocardiography, and gas exchange analysis during rest and exercise were used to obtain heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO) for comparison with PhysioFlow®. Results: There was a good correlation between reference methods and ICG for HR, SV, CO at rest and CO at peak exercise (r = 0.69–0.77, p < .001) and a very good correlation for peak HR (r = 0.91, p < .0001). ICG overestimated SV at rest, CO at rest, and peak CO, which resulted in low intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC = 0.250 and 0.570). Conclusions: ICG can serve as a good estimate of basic hemodynamic parameters during rest and exercise in wheelchair rugby players but overestimates stroke volume and cardiac output."
33,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to adopt an explicitly intersectional approach to examine the experiences of women identifying as having a visual impairment and as being overweight or obese in integrated physical education (PE). Method: An interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) research approach was used, and six women (ages 25–34) with visual impairments who identified as being overweight or obese acted as participants. The sources of data included semistructured audiotaped telephone interviews and reflective interview notes. Data were analyzed thematically using a three-step analytic process informed by IPA. Results: Based on the data analysis, three inter-related themes emerged. The first theme, restricted/reluctant participation, described participants’ experiences with PE activity restrictions and the influence of visual impairment and overweight or obesity on these restrictions. The second theme, teacher discrimination, described participants’ recollection of discriminatory practices by physical educators that were influenced by perceptions of inability. Finally, the third theme, isolation, teasing and surveillance issues, described challenging social instances and how those instances were influenced by body size and disability status. Conclusions: Using an IPA approach, three themes emerged that exposed central experiences that were informed by the participants’ identities as individuals with visual impairments and being overweight or obese. Through the lens of intersectionality, these themes contribute to our understanding of how these identities interacted to contribute to disadvantaging experiences in PE."
34,"Purpose: This study examined the relationships between the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1) and resting heart rate variability (HRV) and submaximal 5'-5' test derived measures in novice male soccer players. Methods: Forty players (11.54 ± 0.58 years) from a soccer academy participated in this study, performing physical tests on two different days, separated by 48 h, as follows: (day 1) resting HRV and Yo-Yo IR1 test, and (day 2) anthropometric assessments (for peak height velocity assessment [PHV]) and the 5'-5' test. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was used to determine the correlations between Yo-Yo IR1 performance and the remaining variables. A partial correlation analysis was further performed using age, stature, body mass, distance to PHV, and age at PHV as “confounders.” Results: The highest correlation score was observed between Yo-Yo IR1 performance and resting HRV, when the absolute age was used as confounder (r = 0.72; p < .05). Conclusions: We observed that a practical measure of parasympathetic activity at rest is largely associated with performance obtained during a traditional intermittent endurance performance test."
35,"Purpose: Given criticism of P-12 physical education and wide variability in instructional quality and subject matter outcomes in the United States (US), a national curriculum has been debated by some scholars as a mechanism for improving the status of the subject matter. Grounded in the systemic reform (SR) model, the purpose of this study was to explore physical education teacher education (PETE) leaders’ perceptions regarding the implementation of a national curriculum. Method: In total, 28 individuals participated in in-depth interviews that were inductively/deductively coded and triangulated. Results: Themes indicated that nationalizing the curriculum has the potential to offer explicit educational goals, substantial pedagogical guidelines, and valid assessments. Despite recognizing the potential benefits of national curriculum, however, the majority of participants were opposed because of the inflexibility of such a system in the culturally and geographically diverse school contexts across the US. Conclusions: The concept of national curriculum can be differently interpreted in different countries based on sociocultural, historical, and contextual factors, and its relevance depends primarily on one’s perceptions and previous experiences."
36,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the agreement of five commercially available accelerometers in estimating energy expenditure while performing an acute bout of high-intensity functional training (HIFT). Methods: Participants (n = 47; average age: 28.5 ± 11.6 years) consisted of recreationally active, healthy adults. Each participant completed a session of HIFT: a 15-minute workout consisting of 12 repetitions each of air-squats, sit-ups, push-ups, lunges, pull-ups, steps-ups, and high-knees; performed circuit-style by completing as many rounds as possible. During this session, each participant wore the Cosmed K4b2 portable metabolic analyzer (PMA) and five different accelerometers (ActiGraph GT3X, Nike Fuelband, Fitbit One, Fitbit Charge HR, and Jawbone UP Move). Results: Four of the five activity trackers reported lower (p < .05) total EE values compared to the PMA during the acute bout of HIFT. The waist-mounted device (ActiGraph, 182.55 ± 37.93 kcal) was not significantly different from, and most closely estimated caloric expenditure compared to the PMA (144.99 ± 37.13 kcal) (p = .056). A repeated-measures ANOVA showed that all activity trackers were significantly different from the reference measure (PMA) (p < .05). Systematic relative agreement between the activity trackers was calculated, exhibiting a significant ICC = 0.426 (F [46,230] = 5.446 [p < .05]). Conclusion: The wrist- and hip-mounted activity trackers did not accurately assess energy expenditure during HIFT exercise. With the exception of the ActiGraph GT3X, the remaining four activity trackers showed inaccurate estimates of the amount of kilocalories expended during the HIFT exercise bout compared to the PMA."
37,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate (a) time-dependent changes in muscle damage (MD) biomarkers, oxidative stress (OS) indices, and maximum strength performance; (b) the relationship between changes in maximum strength performance and changes in MD and OS indices; and (c) whether eccentric exercise-induced MD is related to OS. Method: Twenty-nine male volunteers (age: 22.13 ± 3.1 years) participated in the study. Participants performed 60 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors at a constant velocity of 60°·s-1. Maximum isokinetic strength (MIS), visual analog scale soreness scores, serum creatine kinase (CK) activity, total antioxidant status, total oxidant status (TOS), protein carbonyl (PCO), and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine level were analyzed. Blood samples were obtained before, immediately after, and 24 h, 48 h, and 96 h after the eccentric exercise. Change in total work (%<U+0394>TWk), peak torque (%<U+0394>PT), and OS index were calculated. Results: CK, PCO, and TOS significantly increased over time (p < .05). However, no significant main effect was observed for MIS or any other investigated biomarkers (p > .05). MIS was not related to MD or OS indices. However, %<U+0394>TWk demonstrated a moderate inverse correlation with OS indices. No significant relationship was observed between %<U+0394>PT and any of the selected biomarkers. Conclusions: Our findings confirm the hypothesis that acute eccentric exercise increases MD biomarkers and OS indices. However, indices of OS damage were significantly related, particularly, to the strength loss of flexors. This finding suggests that the decline in strength performance is not the primary determinant of the magnitude of MD following voluntary eccentric contraction."
38,"Purpose: Most built environment studies have quantified characteristics of the areas around participants’ homes. However, the environmental exposures for physical activity (PA) are spatially dynamic rather than static. Thus, merged accelerometer and global positioning system (GPS) data were utilized to estimate associations between the built environment and PA among adults. Methods: Participants (N = 142) were recruited on trails in Massachusetts and wore an accelerometer and GPS unit for 1–4 days. Two binary outcomes were created: moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA vs. light PA-to-sedentary); and light-to-vigorous PA (LVPA vs. sedentary). Five built environment variables were created within 50-meter buffers around GPS points: population density, street density, land use mix (LUM), greenness, and walkability index. Generalized linear mixed models were fit to examine associations between environmental variables and both outcomes, adjusting for demographic covariates. Results: Overall, in the fully adjusted models, greenness was positively associated with MVPA and LVPA (odds ratios [ORs] = 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03, 1.30 and 1.25, 95% CI = 1.12, 1.41, respectively). In contrast, street density and LUM were negatively associated with MVPA (ORs = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.67, 0.71 and 0.87, 95% CI = 0.78, 0.97, respectively) and LVPA (ORs = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.77, 0.81 and 0.81, 95% CI = 0.74, 0.90, respectively). Negative associations of population density and walkability with both outcomes reached statistical significance, yet the effect sizes were small. Conclusions: Concurrent monitoring of activity with accelerometers and GPS units allowed us to investigate relationships between objectively measured built environment around GPS points and minute-by-minute PA. Negative relationships between street density and LUM and PA contrast evidence from most built environment studies in adults. However, direct comparisons should be made with caution since most previous studies have focused on spatially fixed buffers around home locations, rather than the precise locations where PA occurs."
39,"Purpose: This study aimed to investigate if player tactical skill level and age category influence team performance and player exploratory behavior in tasks with different difficulty levels. Method: In total, 48 youth male soccer players participated in the study (U15, n = 24, mean age = 13.06 ± 1.53 years; U17, n = 24, mean age = 16.89 ± 0.11 years). Player tactical skills were evaluated through the System of Tactical Assessment in Soccer (FUT-SAT), allowing them to be organized into three groups according to tactical efficiency: Higher tactical skill level (Group 01), Intermediate tactical skill level (Group 02), and Lower tactical skill level (Group 03). Next, Group 01 and Group 03 of both categories performed six Small-Sided and Conditioned Games (SSCG) each, namely three High difficulty SSCGs and three Low difficulty SSCGs. Team performance and players’ exploratory behavior were analyzed through the Offensive Sequences Characterization System and Lag Sequential Analysis, respectively. Results: We found that team performance and players’ exploratory behavior were influenced both by the age and tactical skill level of the players, as well as by task difficulty level. Conclusion: Therefore, in an attempt to improve player performance, practitioners must carefully manipulate key task constraints to adapt training task difficulty levels to player age and tactical skill level."
40,"Purpose: Maximal heart rate (MHR) is an important physiologic tool for prescribing and monitoring exercise in both clinical and athletic settings. However, prediction equations developed in adults may have limited accuracy in youth. The purpose of this study was to systematically review and analyze the available evidence regarding the validity of commonly used age-based MHR prediction equations among children and adolescents. Methods: Included articles were peer-reviewed, published in English, and compared measured to predicted MHR in male and female participants <18 years old. The standardized mean difference effect size (ES) was used to quantify the accuracy of age-predicted MHR values and a priori moderators were examined to identify potential sources of variability. Results: The cumulative results of 20 effects obtained from seven articles revealed that prediction equations did not accurately estimate MHR (ES= 0.44, p < .05) by 6.3 bpm (bpm). Subgroup analyses indicated that the Fox equation (MHR = 220–age) overestimated MHR by 12.4 bpm (ES = 0.95, p < .05), whereas the Tanaka equation (MHR = 208–0.7*age) underestimated MHR by 2.7 bpm (ES = -0.34, p < .05). Conclusions: Age-based MHR equations derived from adult populations are not applicable to children. However, if the use of age-based equations cannot be avoided, we recommend using the Tanaka equation, keeping in mind the range of error reported in this study. Future research should control for potential pubertal influences on sympathetic modulation during exercise to facilitate the development of more age-appropriate methods for prescribing exercise intensity."
41,"Purpose: This study aimed to examine the effect of gradual self-control of task difficulty and feedback on accuracy and movement pattern of the golf putting sport skill. Method: Sixty students were quasi-randomly assigned to four groups under a varying combination of the two factors of task difficulty control (self-controlled or yoked) and feedback control (self-controlled or yoked). The participants in the two groups (dual-factor gradual self-control and self-controlled task difficulty group) that granted control over task difficulty in the acquisition phase were told they could choose any of the pre-set distances from the target. All groups were given 100% feedback in the first half of the acquisition phase, but the participants in the two groups (dual-factor gradual self-control group and self-controlled feedback) that could control their feedback were told that in the second half of the acquisition phase they would be able to ask for feedback when needed. The practice schedule of each member of the dual-factor gradual self-control group was used as a basis to plan the practice of predetermined distances and feedback presentation to the corresponding participants in the yoked conditions. Results: ANOVA with repeated measures showed that the practice method involving gradual self-control of two factors had a positive impact on accuracy and movement pattern of golf putting in the retention and transfer tests compared to other methods (ps < .05). Conclusion: The advantages of self-control practice presumably come from better adjustment of challenge points by the learner in the course of the practice."
42,"Purpose: Trampoline parks are becoming popular in many countries, providing recreational facilities for children and adults. This study investigated the effects of trampoline training on knee muscles strength and balance in young adults. Methods: Twenty-six participants (14 males, 12 females) were randomized into trampoline training (TT) and resistance training (RT) groups to undergo a 6-week supervised intervention program (2 × 30 min per week). TT group performed basic trampoline exercises while the RT group performed resistance training targeting lower extremities muscles. Peak knee extension and flexion torque, postural sway characteristics, and Y balance test (YBT) performance were evaluated before and after the intervention. A mixed model analysis of variance (group × time) was applied. Results: After training there were significant improvements in knee extension torque (mean differencepost-pre [95% CI], TT: 0.27 [0.00, 0.54] N·m/kg, RT: 0.31 [0.09,0.54] N·m/kg, p = .001), knee flexion torque (TT: 0.25 [0.17,0.33] N·m/kg, RT: 0.21 [0.08,0.34] N·m/kg, p < .001), and dynamic balance (YBT composite scores, mean differencepost-pre [95% CI], TT: 4.9 [-0.3, 10.2]%, RT: 5.2 [2.4,8.0]%, p = .001). No difference between groups was found. Conclusion: Trampoline training can be as effective as resistance training for improving knee muscles strength and dynamic balance in young men and women."
43,"Purpose: A vertical jump (VJ) is a common task performed in several sports, with the height achieved correlated to skilled performance. Loaded VJs are often used in the training of recreational and professional athletes. The bilateral deficit (BLD), which refers to the difference between the heights achieved by a bilateral jump and the sum of two unilateral jumps, has not been reported for loaded jumps and the findings for unloaded jumps are inconclusive. The purpose of this study was threefold: (a) to quantify and compare BLD in countermovement (CMJ) and squat jumps (SJ), (b) to explore the effects of an additional 10% of body weight (BW) load on the BLD in both CMJ and SJ, and (c) examine the relationship between magnitude of BLD and jump performance in both jumps and conditions. Methods: Forty participants (22 for CMJ and 18 for SJ) performed a bilateral jump and unilateral jumps on each leg with and without an added load equivalent to 10% of each participant’s bodyweight. Results: BLD was evident in all conditions, with CMJ BLD values nearly double those for the SJ. The extra load did not affect the magnitude of BLD. BLD had a significant correlation with unilateral jump height, expect for the 110%BW SJ. Conclusions: BLD is present in SJs and CMJs at both loaded and unloaded conditions. The SJs have about half of the BLD observed in CMJs regardless of additional load. Participants who had higher single leg jumps seemed to also have higher BLDs, but there was no evidence of association between the bilateral jump height and BLD."
44,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in metabolic responses between the track and the treadmill (1% inclination) running. The latter is recommended for use in laboratory settings to mimic outdoor running. Method: Seventeen male endurance athletes (mean 25.8, s = 3.8 years) performed 4-min running bouts on an indoor track and the treadmill. Results: At all speeds (11, 13, and 15 km·h-1) athletes showed better economy on the track running compared to the treadmill expressed as oxygen (7.9%, 5.2%, and 2.8%) and caloric (7.0%, 5.3%, and 2.6%) unit cost. Rating of perceived exertion was evaluated substantially higher at all speeds on the treadmill (F(1,16) = 31.45, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .663) compared to running on the track. Participants presented lower heart rate (F(1,16) = 13.74, p = .002, <U+03B7>2p = .462) on the track at the speed of 11 and 13 km·h-1 compared to the treadmill, but not at 15 km·h-1 (p = .021). Conclusions: We conclude that constant inclination (i.e.. 1%) during the treadmill test might not be suitable to reproduce comparable effort to running on the track; rather, there is an optimal treadmill inclination for different intensities to reproduce similar effort compared to the track running."
45,"Purpose: The present study aimed to compare the vertical ground reaction force responses during the performance of the stationary running water-based exercise with and without equipment at different cadences by elderly women. Method: Nineteen elderly women (age: 68.6 ± 5.0 years; body mass: 69.0 ± 9.5 kg; height: 154.9 ± 5.6 cm) completed one session consisting of the performance of the water-based stationary running with elbow flexion and extension immersed to the xiphoid process depth. The exercise was performed in three conditions, without equipment, with water-floating and with water-resistance equipment, at three cadences (80 b·min-1, 100 b·min-1 and maximal) in a randomized order. Peak and impulse of vertical ground reaction force were collected during the exercise using an underwater force plate. Repeated measures two-way ANOVA was used (a = 0.05). Results: Peak vertical ground reaction force (p < .001) and impulse (p = 0.002) resulted in lower values for the water-floating use (0.42–0.48 BW and 0.07–0.13 N.s/BW) in comparison to the water-resistance equipment use (0.46–0.60 BW and 0.09–0.16 N.s/BW) and to the non-use of equipment (0.45–0.60 BW and 0.07–0.17 N.s/BW), except for the impulse at the maximal cadence. In addition, peak vertical ground reaction force at 80 b·min-1 (p = .002) and impulse at the maximal cadence (p < .001) showed lower values compared to the other cadences. Conclusion: The use of water-floating equipment minimizes the vertical ground reaction force during the stationary running water-based exercise performed by elderly women regardless of the cadence."
46,"Purpose: This study examined the test-retest reliability and feasibility of select fitness assessments in 7–12 year old children on the autism spectrum. Method: Participants (N = 14; n = 1 female; Mage = 9.5 ± 1.7 years) completed 7 fitness assessments, administered in a random order, on two occasions: Bruce protocol; Modified 6-minute walk test (M6MWT); Wingate anaerobic cycling test; muscle power sprint test (MPST); sit & reach; standing long jump; and grip strength. Intraclass correlations (two-way mixed with absolute agreement) were computed to examine test-retest reliability. Feasibility was assessed by questionnaire following the first administration of each test. Results: The Wingate (ICC = .956), standing long jump (ICC = .925), grip strength (ICC = .913), and sit and reach (ICC = .829) tests demonstrated good- to- excellent reliability, while the Bruce protocol (ICC = .811), M6MWT (ICC = .510), and MPST (ICC = .703) demonstrated moderate- to- good reliability based on the 95% confidence intervals of the ICC. All tests demonstrated assessor-rated feasibility scores of 70/100 or higher and child-rated feasibility scores of 66/100 or higher. Conclusion: The results demonstrate moderate- to excellent test-retest reliability for select fitness tests. Short, single-instruction (e.g., standing long jump) tests may be more reliable than lengthier assessments (e.g., M6MWT) in this population. Implications of this work include the ability of practitioners and researchers to feasibly and reliably measure the fitness of school-aged children on the autism spectrum for ongoing health and behavioural monitoring and intervention purposes."
47,"Purpose: Given the unequal distribution of physical activity (PA) opportunities across middle schools, alternative options for promoting it should be explored. Faith-based schools are positioned to offer religious-themed PA interventions, yet few have been reported. We replicated previous research by investigating the effects of the Physical Activity for Lent (PAL) program on change in step count (<U+0394>PA) and its associations with religiosity, enjoyment, and motivation (four subscales). Method: Over the 6-week Lenten season, three Catholic middle schools’ students (n = 128) participated in a randomly allocated controlled crossover trial of a pedometer-based virtual journey that followed Jesus’s life path. We used the Reliable Change Index (RCI), general linear mixed models, and logistic regression to identify changes (pre- to post-Lent) in the independent variables, and their association with <U+0394>PA overall and of being in the highest <U+0394>PA tertile. Results: Between 11.6% (religiosity) and 34.7% (external regulation) of participants’ scores changed. School (School 3 > Schools 1 and 2 by ~2,400 steps/day, p < .001) and grade (6th grade > 7th and 8th grades by ~2,500 steps/day, p < .001) – but not religiosity, enjoyment, or motivation – were significant predictors of <U+0394>PA. As RCI for intrinsic motivation and identified regulation increased, students were more (OR = 2.49) and less (OR = 0.74) likely, respectively, to be in the high <U+0394>PA tertile. Conclusion: Desirable <U+0394>PA was situational (i.e., school, grade) and highest <U+0394>PA tertile was associated with autonomous motivation. Faith-based PA interventions may need to include additional components to realize even greater gains."
48,"Purpose: Children who do not learn their fundamental motor skills (FMS) are more likely to be unskilled, sedentary adults. By consequence, it behooves those teaching physical education to put in place mechanisms that promote as well as motivate children to master their FMS. One approach to achieving this goal is through the adoption of mastery motivational climates (MMC) in physical education. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a year-long (9-month) MMC physical education program on preschool children’s FMS learning. Method: Participants (N = 96, MMC = 58, Comparison = 38) completed the Test of Gross Motor Development-Third Edition prior to and after intervention. Intact classrooms were randomly assigned to either a MMC or comparison group. A repeated measures nested MANOVA was used to test changes by group. Follow-up measurements included univariate repeated measures and simple effects analyses. Results: There were no significant multivariate differences based on class membership (p = .249), indicating the nested structure was not associated with any meaningful differences in test scores. There was a significant multivariate difference based on the interaction of time (pre- versus post-test) and group (p < .001). Both locomotor and ball skills significantly varied between groups and across time. Children in both groups improved from pre-test to post-test, but the rate of improvement was significantly greater for the MMC group. Conclusions: A year-long MMC intervention is beneficial for improving children’s FMS."
49,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the acute effects of general warm-up (GWU) and GWU plus dynamic stretching (GWU + DS) on endurance running performance in well-trained male runners. Method: The endurance running performances of eight well-trained long-distance male runners were assessed on a treadmill after 2 types of intervention for 5 min after running on the treadmill at a velocity equivalent to 70% maximal oxygen uptake (V<U+0307>O2max) in each athlete for 15 min. The interventions were GWU and GWU + DS. In the GWU + DS intervention, dynamic stretching was performed for ten repetitions as quickly as possible for the five muscle groups of the lower extremities. The total duration of the dynamic stretching was 3 min and 45 s. Endurance running performance was assessed at 1 min 15 s after the dynamic stretching. The endurance running performance was evaluated by the time to exhaustion (TTE) during running at a velocity equivalent to 90% V<U+02D9>O2max in each athlete. Results: The TTE (640.6 ± 220.4 s) after GWU + DS intervention was significantly (d = 1.02, p = .03) shorter than that (760.6 ± 249.1 s) after GWU intervention. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that GWU + DS intervention impaired immediate endurance performance of running at a velocity equivalent to 90% V<U+02D9>O2max in well-trained male runners compared with GWU intervention. Thus, we are not able to recommend that well-trained runners and their coaches use the protocol for GWU + DS described in this study during actual warm-ups."
50,"Purpose: The purposes of the present study were to (a) compare context-specific conceptions of friendship quality in youth sport and music, and (b) determine how friendship quality is related to motivational beliefs in sport and music. Method: Adolescents (N = 366; Mage = 12.9, SD = 1.0) who were involved in both organized sport and music completed measures of domain-specific friendship quality, perceived competence, enjoyment, anxiety, and motivational orientation. Results: For purpose one, a repeated-measures MANOVA revealed that (a) boys and girls rated their best sport friends higher in self-esteem enhancement and supportiveness than their best music friends, (b) boys rated their best sport friends higher in loyalty and intimacy, things in common, companionship and pleasant play, and conflict resolution than their best music friends, (c) girls rated positive friendship quality dimensions higher than boys, and (d) there were no domain or gender differences in friendship conflict. For purpose two, structural equation modeling revealed that (a) for sport, positive friendship quality dimensions were directly associated with perceived competence and indirectly associated with enjoyment, anxiety, and motivational orientation, and (b) for music, positive friendship quality and friendship conflict were related to competence motivation variables. Conclusion: Collectively, findings indicate domain differences in friendship quality and the relationship between friendship quality and motivational outcomes in sport and music. Despite some domain differences, findings demonstrate the significance of friendship quality for adolescents involved in sport and music."
51,"Purpose: This study aims to analyze changes in Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP), lung function, cardiorespiratory fitness, and blood pressure, in 10 healthy active elderly women, following 7 weeks of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) combined with a multicomponent training program (MCTP). The association among these health parameters, their changes after training (deltas), and the influence of MIP at baseline (MIPpre) are also considered. Methods: IMT involved 30 inspirations at 50% of the MIP, twice daily, 7 days a week, while MCTP was 1 hr, twice a week. MIP, lung function (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75%, PEF), 6MWT, and blood pressure (SBP, DBP), jointly with body composition, were assessed before and after the intervention. Results: Seven weeks were enough to improved MIP (p = .019; d = 1.397), 6MWT (p = .012; d = .832), SBP (p = .003; d = 1.035) and DBP (p = .024; d = .848). Despite the high physical fitness (VO2 peak: M = 23.38, SD = 3.39 ml·min·Kg-1), MIPpre was low (M = 39.00, SD = 7.63 cmH2O) and displayed a significant negative correlation with <U+0394>MIPpre-post (r = -.821; p < .004), showing that women who started the intervention with lower MIP achieved higher improvements in inspiratory muscle strength after training. Conclusions: No significant changes in spirometric parameters may signal that lung function is independent of early improvements in inspiratory muscles and cardiorespiratory fitness. Absence of correlation between physical fitness and respiratory outcomes suggests that being fit does not ensure cardiorespiratory health in active elderly women, so IMT might be beneficial and should supplement the MCTP in this population."
52,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the job histories of physical education teacher education (PETE) graduates over a 15-year span. Method: A total of 118 graduates/participants completed a Qualtrics, open-ended survey. Face validity of the survey questions was established via a panel of experts and the survey was pilot-tested by PE teachers. Data were analyzed inductively via constant comparison. Trustworthiness of the data was addressed via peer debriefing and the use of member checks. Results: During the first year after graduation, of the 118 participants in this study, 82% were employed in schools, with 48% securing full-time teaching positions in health and/or PE, and adapted physical education (APE), and the other 34% in roles such as part-time teaching. Ultimately, 75% of graduates taught full-time in health, PE and/or APE. A total of 7% of those who taught opted to leave teaching. Almost all of the 80 participants still teaching planned to teach till retirement, or a very long time, with none stating that they planned to leave the profession soon. A few (3%) stated that they were undecided, however. Conclusion: There is a lack of research in the area of job histories of PETE graduates in the United States, and much of the overall research on organizational socialization is dated. The authors hope to spur further inquiry into this important area. The results of this study are encouraging but follow up studies are envisioned to further examine issues such as job satisfaction and teacher/coach orientations from acculturation through the life span of teachers."
53,"Purpose: Despite the well-known health benefits of physical activity (PA), disadvantaged populations usually have lower PA levels than the rest of the population. Some intra- and interpersonal factors such as different types of barriers to PA may influence PA levels, particularly among disadvantaged adult women. The first aim of this qualitative study was to identify the barriers to PA perceived by disadvantaged adult women. The second aim was to analyse the differences in perceived barriers to PA between adult Roma and non-Roma women. Methods: Eleven disadvantaged adult women participated in the current study (M = 37.72; SD = 8.34), seven of whom belonged to the Roma population. Data were obtained from discussion groups as well as from one-to-one interviews, and these were analysed by NVivo Pro 11. Results: Three categories of perceived barriers to PA were identified: personal (i.e., economy, labour, physical limitations, illness, and psychological characteristics) social (i.e., culture, lack of social support, and family), and environmental. Family was identified as the main common and most frequent barrier to PA in disadvantaged adult women. Differences in perceived barriers to PA between adult Roma and non-Roma women were found. While Roma women perceived culture, physical limitations, and lack of social support barriers to PA, non-Roma women mainly perceived labour-related barriers to PA. Conclusions: Multilevel interventions addressing specific barriers to PA for disadvantaged adult women are required to overcome barriers to PA and, consequently, increase PA levels. Particular attention should be paid to specific barriers to PA among adult Roma and non-Roma women, respectively."
54,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine whether structured physical activity (PA) in a family-based community exercise program affects PA of young children and parents. Method: Twenty-two children (mean ± SD; age, 4.9 ± 2.1 years) and their parents (age, 34.3 ± 7.6 years) participated in unstructured PA sessions followed by either short- or long-duration structured PA sessions, while wearing an ActiGraph GT9X activity monitor on their right hip to estimate PA. Independent t-tests compared children’s and parents’ PA during short- and long-structured PA sessions. Paired t-tests compared short- versus long-structured PA sessions. A mixed model ANOVA compared PA during unstructured versus structured sessions and between children and parents. Results: Children spent proportionately more time in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and had higher accelerometer counts/min than parents during short-structured PA (children:60.9 ± 18.8% vs. parents:17.7 ± 6.8%, children:3870 ± 742 vs. parents:1836 ± 556 counts/min, p < .05) and long-structured PA (children:61.1 ± 20.1% vs. parents:12.6 ± 4.9%, children:3415 ± 758 vs. parents:1604 ± 633 counts/min, p < .05). No statistical differences were found between short- and long-structured PA sessions for proportion of time spent in MVPA or counts/min for children or parents (all, p > .05). Children spent proportionally more time in MVPA and had higher counts/min during unstructured PA compared to structured PA (unstructured MVPA:54.4 ± 3.9% vs. structured MVPA:38.2 ± 4.2%, unstructured counts/min:3830 ± 222 vs. structured counts/min:2768 ± 239 counts/min; p < .05). Conclusions: Children were more active than parents during both the unstructured and structured PA sessions. However, unstructured PA sessions resulted in 63–77% and 10–11% of PA recommendations for children and adults, respectively. Family-based exercise programming can provide an opportunity for children and their parents to attain MVPA during the week."
55,"Purpose: The role of a structured program of exercise training on the low-risk pregnancy in Iranian women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) based on the reduction of gestational diabetes was examined. Method: A comparative quasi-experimental clinical trial with 170 IVF-pregnant women in two intervention and control groups was studied to monitor the training effect of physical activities in terms of walking, and aerobic, strength-conditioning, and relaxation exercises during pregnancy on the improvement of maternal and fetal health. Gestational diabetes as the main complication was evaluated with 2-h 75-g OGTT and FBS tests in 24–28 and 34- weeks’ gestation, respectively. Other adverse maternal (e.g., preeclampsia, cesarean section, and preterm delivery) and neonatal (e.g., intrauterine growth retardation, low/high birth weight, and fetal death) outcomes were determined and analyzed by statistical and regression tests. Results: A significantly lower gestational diabetes and preeclampsia rate was found in the intervened IVF-pregnant women with the maintenance of an active lifestyle. Although there was no significant difference in other negative maternal and neonatal outcomes between the two groups, lower symptoms from these complications were recorded in IVF-pregnant women trained with regular exercise activities. Conclusion: Implementing the physical activity program by IVF-women during pregnancy is an effective intervention strategy in reducing the risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes."
56,"Purpose: To evaluate vascular function and its relationship to cardiorespiratory fitness in professional handball athletes. Method: We examined 30 male professional handball athletes (age 27 ± 4 y) and 10 male sedentary controls (age 26 ± 5 y) at rest. The workup included exercise testing via ergometry. To assess vascular function, a validated electronic model of the arterial tree (vasc assist 2®) was used. It replicates noninvasively acquired pulse pressure waves by modulating the relevant functional parameters of compliance, resistance, inertia, pressure, and flow. The maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) was estimated using the validated heart rate ratio method. Results: Athletes had a significantly lower systolic and diastolic central blood pressure (cBP) compared to controls (102 ± 9/60 ± 9 vs. 110 ± 8/74 ± 9 mmHg, p < .01), whereas aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) (6.2 ± 0.8 vs. 6.3 ± 0.5 m/s, p = .45) and augmentation index at a heart rate of 75 (Aix@75) (-4 ± 12 vs. -13 ± 16%, p = .06) were not different. Resistance index (R) (15.9 ± 4.4 vs. 10.6 ± 0.6, p = .001) and maximum power output (MPO) (3.55 ± 0.54 vs. 2.46 ± 0.55 Watt/kg, p < .001) were significantly higher in athletes compared to controls. We found no relevant correlation between MPO, resting heart rate, PWV, Aix@75, and cBP. A higher VO2max (p = .02) and a lower R (p < .01) were significant predictors of a higher MPO in athletes. Conclusion: R had an independent and strong correlation to MPO in athletes, which might help to disentangle the contribution of aerobic capacity and arterial function to physical power."
57,"Purpose: To study the pacing behavior and performance of novice youth exercisers in a controlled laboratory setting. Method: Ten healthy participants (seven male, three female, 15.8 ± 1.0 years) completed four, 2-km trials on a Velotron cycling ergometer. Visit 1 was a familiarization trial. Visits 2 to 4 involved the following conditions, in randomized order: no opponent (NO), a virtual opponent (starting slow and finishing fast) (OP-SLOWFAST), and a virtual opponent (starting fast and finishing slow) (OP-FASTSLOW). Repeated measurement ANOVAs (p < .05) were used to examine differences in both pacing behavior and also performance related to power output, finishing- and split times, and RPE between the four successive visits and the three conditions. Expected performance outcome was measured using a questionnaire. Results: Power output increased (F3,27 = 5.651, p = .004, <U+03B7>2p = .386) and finishing time decreased (F3,27 = 9.972, p < .001, <U+03B7>2p = .526) between visit 1 and visits 2, 3 and 4. In comparison of the first and second visit, the difference between expected finish time and actual finishing time decreased by 66.2%, regardless of condition. The only significant difference observed in RPE score was reported at the 500 m point, where RPE was higher during visit 1 compared to visits 3 and 4, and during visit 2 compared to visit 4 (p < .05). No differences in pacing behavior, performance, or RPE were found between conditions (p > .05). Conclusion: Performance was improved by an increase in experience after one visit, parallel with the ability to anticipate future workload."
58,"Purpose: To compare children’s energy expenditure (EE) levels during object projection skill performance (OPSP; e.g., kicking, throwing, striking) as assessed by hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers. Method: Forty-two children (female n = 20, Mage = 8.1 ± 0.8 years) performed three, nine-minute sessions of kicking, over-arm throwing, and striking at performance intervals of 6, 12, and 30 seconds. EE was estimated using indirect calorimetry (COSMED k4b2) and accelerometers (ActiGraph GT3X+) worn on three different locations (hip, dominant-wrist, and non-dominant-wrist) using four commonly used cut-points. Bland-Altman plots were used to analyze the agreement in EE estimations between accelerometry and indirect calorimetry (METS). Chi-square goodness of fit tests were used to examine the agreement between accelerometry and indirect calorimetry. Results: Hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers underestimated EE, compared to indirect calorimetry, during all performance conditions. Skill practice at a rate of two trials per minute resulted in the equivalent of moderate PA and five trials per minute resulted in vigorous PA (as measured by indirect calorimetry), yet was only categorized as light and/or moderate activity by all measured forms of accelerometry. Conclusion: This is one of the first studies to evaluate the ability of hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers to predict PA intensity levels during OPSP in children. These data may significantly impact PA intervention measurement strategies by revealing the lack of validity in accelerometers to accurately predict PA levels during OPSP in children."
59,"Purpose: The concepts of creativity and intuition have been well studied in isolation, but less is known about their distinctive contributions to option generation in decision making. Method: We examined the relation between creative and intuitive decision making in two studies—one involving coaches and one involving soccer players—using video footage of real soccer matches. Additionally, we analyzed whether this relation is culture generic or culture specific by conducting matched cross-cultural studies in a European and a South American country. Results: In Study 1, results indicate a conceptual overlap of creativity and intuition for Brazilian and German soccer coaches. Furthermore, coaches did not differ in their evaluation of creative and intuitive actions of players of both cultures. In Study 2, we found that for both subsamples the total number of generated options was positively correlated with the quality of the first and the final option and that the quality of players’ first (intuitive) option was higher than that of options generated later. Moreover, results indicate a positive correlation between a player’s creativity score and the quality of the first generated option for the whole sample. Conclusion: Overall, our findings provide meaningful information regarding athletes’ and coaches’ option-generation processes in decision making in complex team sports."
60,"Purpose: Work ability of physical education teachers (PETs) is important to promote physical activity and effective teaching process. However, there was a limited study. In this study, work ability of the Turkish PETs was investigated. Method: The mixed methods were used. The study group consisted of 407 (Mage = 36.52 ± 6.9) PETs. “The Work Ability Questionnaire” was used as a data collection tool. Descriptive statistic, independent sample t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), multiple regression analysis, and chi-square were used in the analysis of qualitative data, and content analysis was used in the analysis of quantitative data. Result: The PETs were satisfied with their current job, and while there was a significant difference according to the gender (p < .05), a significant difference was not detected according to the age (p > .05). Furthermore, the PETs had a high work ability; when the comparison according to the gender and age significant differences was found (p < .05). Also, it was found that job satisfaction predicted physical fitness, work ability, work motivation, and work atmosphere of the PETs (R2 = .463, F = 30.945, p < .05). Some of the PETs had a physical disease affecting their work abilities, and most of the PETs had musculoskeletal and respiratory diseases. In the comparison, according to gender, a significant difference was not found in terms of injury or disease (p > .05). Moreover, health problems were seen as the main problems which will threaten for the future work abilities. Conclusion: Higher work ability was associated with positive outcomes and higher job satisfaction. The healthy PETs had more work abilities."
61,"Purpose: The association between an overlooked classical Lactate Threshold (LT), named “Minimum Lactate Equivalent” (LEmin), with Maximal Lactate Steady State (MLSS) has been recently described with good MLSS prediction results in endurance-trained runners. This study aimed to determine the applicability of LEmin to predict MLSS in lower aerobic-conditioned individuals compared to well-established blood lactate-related thresholds (BLTs). Method: Fifteen soccer players [velocity at MLSS (MLSSV) 13.2 ± 1.0 km·h-1; coefficient of variation (CV) 7.6%] conducted a submaximal discontinuous incremental running test to determine BLTs and 3–6 constant velocity running tests to determine MLSSV. Results: LEmin did not differ from conventional LTs (p > .05) and was 24% lower than MLSS (p < .001; ES: 3.26). Among LTs, LEmin best predicted MLSSV (r = 0.83; p < .001; SEE = 0.59 km·h-1). There was no statistical difference between MLSS and estimated MLSS using LEmin prediction formula (p = .99; ES: 0.001). Mean bias and limits of agreement were 0.00 ± 0.58 km·h-1 and ±1.13 km·h-1, respectively. LEmin best predicted MLSSV (r = 0.92; p < .001; SEE = 0.54 km·h-1) in the pooled data of soccer players and endurance-trained runners of the previous study (n = 28; MLSSV range 11.2–16.5 km·h-1; CV 9.8%). Conclusion: Results support LEmin to be one of the best single predictors of MLSS. This study is the sole study providing specific operational regression equations to estimate the impractical gold standard MLSSV in soccer players by means of a BLT measured during a submaximal single-session test."
62,"Purpose: This study aimed (1) to compare physical activity (PA) indicators, metabolic biomarkers, and comorbidity, (2) to investigate the relationship between PA indicators and metabolic biomarkers, comorbidity and (3) to identify barriers to PA in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who are using oral hypoglycaemic agent (OHA) or combined OHA and insulin (OHAiN). Methods: Sixty-one patients were classified as patients using only OHA or combined OHAiN. Metabolic biomarkers (waist-to-hip ratio, body mass index (BMI), lipid profile, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, comorbidity and PA indicators (self-reported PA, number of steps (NOS), 6-minute walking distance (6MWD)) were assessed. PA perceptions and reasons for inactivity were questioned. Results: The comorbidity (p = .013), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p = .026), total cholesterol (p = .008) and HbA1c (p = .020) were higher and PA level was lower (p = .007) in the OHAiN group. NOS was positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p = .037) and negatively correlated with BMI (p = .007). 6MWD was negatively correlated with BMI (p = .014) and comorbidity (p = .004) in the OHA group. BMI was a significant predictor of NOS (adjusted R2 = 0.242) and comorbidity for 6MWD (adjusted R2 = 0.250) in the OHA group. The majority of the patients (OHA = 34.3%, OHAiN = 42.3%) reported “lack of time” as the most common barrier to PA. Conclusions: This study showed that patients on OHAiN have lower PA levels, poorer metabolic profiles, and higher comorbidity rates than OHA users. PA indicators were related with some metabolic biomarkers and comorbidity in only OHA users. The most common reason for inactivity was “the lack of time” in both groups."
63,"Purpose: A paucity of literature examines how doctoral students are prepared for the transition into physical education teacher education faculty roles. Given the need to understand how doctoral programs impact such preparation, we sought to investigate this process using a longitudinal approach grounded in occupational socialization theory. Method: Fourteen participants (8 males, 6 female) were interviewed during final stages of doctoral programs and their first years in faculty positions; questions focused on key socializing agents and experiences that shaped their preparation for their academic careers. Data were analyzed using a constant comparison approach entailing open and axial coding. Results: Strong advisor-advisee relationships and finding a supportive department culture during one’s first faculty position were key socializing mechanisms. Participants who independently sought research experiences transitioned more smoothly into faculty roles; however, many had heavy teaching loads which conflicted with ambitions to regularly conduct research. Further, some faculty members experienced tense sociopolitical environments which hindered their productivity and confidence in current job roles. Conclusions: Our results speak to the challenges and successes that faculty members experience as they transition into the academy. Findings have implications for further research and practice to enhance the quality of doctoral education and faculty induction programs."
64,"Purpose: Quality physical education (PE) reaches many objectives (e.g., knowledge, physical fitness, and physical skills) and could provide at least half the dose of recommended daily physical activity for youths if their opportunity to learn is provided according to national professional recommendations (min/week) and related state mandates. A 2015 California class-action lawsuit required affected schools to post data indicating they scheduled PE time meeting the state mandate of 200 min per 10-day period. The extent to which schools posted PE schedules on their websites and demographic factors related to their compliance was investigated in this study. Method: We performed a quantitative, cross-sectional content analysis of the websites of 37 school districts plus a random sample of 860 elementary schools in them. Z tests were used to analyze frequencies/proportions and associations among demographic (e.g., Hispanic enrollment, PE specialist) and PE schedule variables (e.g., schools meeting state-mandated PE time). Results: Twenty-two districts (59.4%) had websites with =1 page/document related to PE opportunities. Only 11% of schools posted PE schedules, an event that was associated with employing a PE specialist (p = .01). Of schools posting schedules, 68% specified a PE volume that met the state mandate. Meeting the mandate was independently associated with enrolling a minority of Hispanic students (p = .02). Conclusion: Websites can provide information about the importance/occurrence of PE; however, schools in the lawsuit did not use the potential of their websites to inform constituents either about the lawsuit or their PE programs. Non-compliant schools should adjust PE schedules to meet statutory requirements."
